Hi There,
    I am a Mechanical Engineer and yeah I like to build stuff. I also keep a keen interest in Astronomy and Cosmology. I possess skills ranging from Sketching, Music and Intutive Thinking to Coding, ML, Business Mathematics and Engineering(duh!); also I'm slightly good at Mentalism. I am an ambivert person, and a man of means. I kinda possess a sense of serenity way beyond my age (I might have to change this in the comming years!); a good sense of humour, which can be dark now and then. I am open to all sorts of experiences and challenges, so hook me up if you think I can help you. 

### About the Blog

I was searching for ways to put out the ideas and thoughts that I have been having, and thus ended up making this. Hope you enjoy.
